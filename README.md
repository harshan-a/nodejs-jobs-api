### 💼 About the Project
  - The Jobs API Server is a backend application designed to manage job-related data through a secure and well-structured REST API. It allows authenticated users to create, read, update, and delete job records while enforcing access control through token-based authentication.
  - This project was developed as a learning exercise to understand how production-ready APIs are built, secured, and documented for real-world use.

### ✨ Features
  - RESTful API for job management (create, retrieve, update, delete)
  - Secure JWT-based authentication for protected routes
  - User-specific access to job data
  - Proper request validation and error handling
  - Swagger API documentation for easy testing and reference
  - Stateless backend architecture suitable for scalable applications
